# Ninja Hiro 1.0

Thanks for checking out my pixel art ninja game, **Ninja Hiro**! It's inspired by my two Shiba Inus, Hiro and Hana.

I've always wanted to get into game development, so I committed to this project as a way to dive in and learn through experience. With *Ninja Hiro*, I aim to showcase my ability to continuously update, refactor, and debug an evolving codebase.

This project has deepened my understanding of how individual components interact within a larger system. It has led to multiple structural revisions and improvements, highlighting my practical grasp of object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and modularity.

Most of the tile assets and character animations were created or edited by me at the pixel level, reflecting both my dedication and enjoyment of the craft. I plan to continue expanding the game as a passion project.

I had a lot of fun developing it into what it is today. Thanks again for checking it out, and I hope you enjoy playing!
